# Data Structures Visualizer

This is a web-based application to visualize common data structures and their operations. The goal of this project is to help users understand how data structures like Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Binary Trees work, using interactive visualizations.

## Features

### Supported Data Structures
- **Array**
  - Add elements
  - Remove elements
- **Stack**
  - Push elements
  - Pop elements
- **Queue**
  - Enqueue elements
  - Dequeue elements
- **Linked List**
  - Add nodes
  - Remove nodes
- **Binary Tree**
  - Add nodes
  - Traverse the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

### Highlights
- Real-time updates to visualizations.
- Clean and user-friendly interface.
- Easy-to-understand rendering of data structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Use
1. Select a data structure from the navigation bar.
2. Perform operations (e.g., Add, Remove, Push, Pop, Enqueue, Dequeue) using the provided buttons.
3. Visualize the changes in real-time.

### Example Usage
- Navigate to the **Binary Tree** section.
- Add nodes to the tree by providing values.
- Click the **Traverse Tree** button to see traversal results (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).

## Screenshots

_You can add screenshots here to demonstrate the user interface._

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for managing data structures and visualizations.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more traversal methods for Binary Trees.
- Include advanced data structures like Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.
- Improve visual representation of Linked Lists and Binary Trees.
